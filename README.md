# DPhil candidate in Engineering Science

I am a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) candidate in Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, specialising in masonry in-situ testing and material identification (MINT). My research focuses on developing algorithms for material property analysis using vision-based strain data and the Virtual Fields Method (VFM). I am passionate about leveraging technical skills to solve complex engineering problems.

**Technical Skills**: MATLAB, Python, CAD, FEM (DIANA FEA), DIC

### Tic Tac Toe AI Player
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe AI Player project! This is a fun and interactive implementation of the classic game, where you can play against AI opponents trained using different machine learning models. The AI players have been trained on a dataset of my previous Tic Tac Toe games, ensuring they mimic my playing style and designed to challenge you at various difficulty levels.

Choose to play against one of three AI models:
- [**Decision Tree**]({{ site.baseurl }}/tic-tac-toe2): A simple yet effective AI based on decision tree logic. Fast and efficient, but may struggle with complex board states.
- **Random Forest**: A more advanced AI that uses an ensemble of decision trees for better decision-making. More robust and capable of handling a wider variety of board states.
- **Neural Network**: A highly sophisticated AI trained using deep learning techniques. The most advanced and challenging opponent.

**How to Play?** Choose between [Decision Tree]({{ site.baseurl }}/tic-tac-toe2), Random Forest, or Neural Network.
Make Your Move: Click on the board to place your mark (X or O).
Challenge the AI: See if you can outsmart the AI and win the game!

**Why This Project?** This project was created to explore the capabilities of different machine learning models in a simple yet strategic game like Tic Tac Toe. By training the AI on my previous games, I aimed to create opponents that not only play optimally but also reflect my unique playing style. Interested in how it works under the hood? Check out the GitHub repository for the full source code and documentation. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions, feel free to reach out to me directly. Enjoy the game, and may the best player win! ðŸŽ®

[Play Tic-Tac-Toe with your friends]({{ site.baseurl }}/TicTacToe) or try to [beat me in Tic-Tac-Toe]({{ site.baseurl }}/tic-tac-toe2) - or more prcisely, a decision tree trained on my previous games!

### Projects
- **MINT: Masonry in-situ testing and material identification:** Funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the [MINT project](https://testgow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/V048082/1) aims to estimate mechanical properties of existing masonry assets using Digital Image Correlation techniques (DIC) and the Virtual Fields Method (VFM).
- **High-speed camera based operational modal analysis:** This work compares camera-based Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) with conventional EMA using piezoelectric sensors. A Python toolbox, pyOMA, is developed, implementing the Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) method. Validated on a reference structure, the methods are tested on a custom setup, focusing on the impact of sensor weight on modal properties.
- [**AI at BMW MINI Plant Oxford in collaboration with the Oxford SDG Impact Lab**](https://www.sdglab.uk/case-study/student-story-miles-judd)**:** Together with fellows from the Oxford SDG Impact Lab, we collaborated with the BMW MINI Plant Oxford to create a roadmap for deploying AI tools in manufacturing. This initiative aimed to enhance efficiency and sustainability, aligning with the lab's mission to drive impactful, sustainable development.
